# F1/10 Racecar Simulator

This is a fork of the lightweight 2D simulator of the UPenn F1/10 Racecar (<https://github.com/f1tenth/f110_ros>).
Most of the following document was copied from the Penn's repo; we plan to update it in the future.

The simulator can be built with ROS, or it can be used as a standalone C++ library.
Although this document uses ROS Melodic in the instructions, the simulator has been verified to work in ROS Kinetic.

**NOTE:** we are working on more thorough documentation, but for now please read this document.

## ROS

### Dependencies

If you have ```ros-melodic-desktop``` installed, the additional dependencies you must install are:

- tf2_geometry_msgs
- ackermann_msgs
- joy
- map_server

You can install them by running:

    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-melodic-ackermann-msgs ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-map-server

The full list of dependencies can be found in the ```package.xml``` file.

### Installation

To install the simulator package, clone the repo with the simulator and starter code into your catkin workspace:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f110_ros.git
    
Then run ```catkin_make``` to build it:

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

## Quick Start

To run the simulator on its own, run:

    roslaunch f110_simulator simulator.launch

This will launch everything you need for a full simulation; roscore, the simulator, a preselected map, a model of the racecar and the joystick server.

To manually control the car using a keyboard, use the standard WASD buttons for acceleration and steering, and pressing the space bar will bring the car to a halt.
If you are using a joystick, make sure the correct axis is set in ```params.yaml``` for steering and acceleration- this changes between different joysticks

### RVIZ Visualization

With the simulator running, open rviz.
In the left panel at the bottom click the "Add" button, then in the "By topic" tab add the ```/map``` topic and the ```/scan``` topic.
Then in the "By display type" tab add the RobotModel type.
In the left panel under the newly added LaserScan section, change the size to 0.1 meters for a clearer visualization of the lidar (shown in rainbow).

You can use a keyboard or USB joystick to drive the car around, or you can place the car manually by clicking the "2D Pose Estimate button" on the top of the screen and dragging your mouse on the desired pose.

### ROS API

The simulator was set up with two main objectives in mind- similitude to the real car and fast prototyping of racing algorithms. The *simulator* node was written such that it can be swapped out with the F1/10 car itself, and if all topic names remain the same, the same exact code can be run to drive the car. The rest of the ROS nodes are organized so that new planning algorithms can be added quickly and toggled between during driving.

![Simplified graph of ROS nodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f1tenth/f110_ros/master/f110_simulator/media/sim_graph_public.png)

Our public simulator includes a simple *random driver* node as an example for what a planning node should look like. Each planner can listen to the sensor data published by the *simulator* and then publish [AckermannDrive](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/ackermann_msgs/html/msg/AckermannDrive.html) messages to their own specific topic (e.g., ```/random_drive```). The *mux* node listens to all of these topics, then takes the message from whichever planner is turned on and publishes it to the main ```/drive``` topic, which the *simulator* listens to. Note that only the velocity and steering angle specified in the message are used. The *mux* node also listens to joystick and keyboard messages too, for manual driving.
The *behavior controller* node tells the *mux* node which planner is on through the ```/mux``` topic. By default, each planner (including keyboard and joystick) is mapped to a joystick button and keyboard key, and they are simply toggled on and off manually. 
Additionally, upon collision, the car will halt and all mux channels will be clear- nothing will be in control until manual intervention.

To instantly move the car to a new state publish [Pose](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Pose.html) messages to the ```/pose``` topic. This can be useful for scripting the car through a series of automated tests.

The simulated lidar is published to the ```/scan``` topic as [LaserScan](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html) messages.

The pose of the car is broadcast as a transformation between the ```map``` frame and the ```base_link``` frame. ```base_link``` is the center of the rear axis. The ```laser``` frame defines the frame from which the lidar scan is taken and another transform is broadcast between it and ```base_link```.

### What you can do

If you plan to change the behavior of the car beyond keyboard, joystick, or direct pose control, you will mostly be writing new code in new planning nodes and the *behavior controller* node. Steps for adding a new planner are detailed below. By default, the *behavior controller* listens to sensor messages, so you could write the controller such that the car switches autonomously between planners during a race depending on these dynamic inputs.

### Adding a planning node

There are several steps that necessary to adding a new planning node. There is commented out code in each place that details exactly what to do. Here are the steps:

* Make a new node that publishes to a new drive topic- look at *random_walker* for an example
* Launch the node in the launch file ```simulator.launch```
* Make a new ```Channel``` instance at the end of the Mux() constructor in ```mux.cpp```
* Add if statement to the end of the joystick and keyboard callbacks (key\_callback(), joy\_callback) in ```behavior_controller.cpp```

In ```params.yaml```, add the following:

* a new drive topic name
* a new mux index
* a new keyboard character (must be a single alphabet letter)
* a new joystick button index

You'll need to get the mux index and drive topic name in ```mux.cpp``` for the new ```Channel```, and the keyboard character, mux index, and joystick button index will all need to be added as member variables in ```behavior_controller.cpp```. Your planning node will obviously need the drive topic name as well.

### Parameters

The parameters listed below can be modified in the ```params.yaml``` file.

#### Topics

```drive_topic```: The topic to listen to for autonomous driving.

```joy_topic```: The topic to listen to for joystick commands.

```map_topic```: The topic to listen to for maps to use for the simulated scan.

```pose_topic```: The topic to listen to for instantly setting the position of the car.

```pose_rviz_topic```: The topic to listen to for instantly setting the position of the car with Rviz's "2D Pose Estimate" tool.

```scan_topic```: The topic to publish the simulated scan to.

```distance_transform_topic```: The topic to publish a distance transform to for visualization (see the implementation section below).


#### Frames

```base_link```: The frame of the car, specifically the center of the rear axle.

```scan_frame```: The frame of the lidar.

```map_frame```: The frame of the map.

#### Simulator Parameters

```update_pose_rate```: The rate at which the simulator will publish the pose of the car and simulated scan, measured in seconds. Since the dynamics of the system are evaluated analytically, this won't effect the dynamics of the system, however it will effect how often the pose of the car reflects a change in the control input.

#### Car Parameters

```wheelbase```: The distance between the front and rear axle of the racecar, measured in meters. As this distance grows the minimum turning radius of the car increases.

```width```: Width of car in meters

```max_speed```: The maximum speed of the car in meters per second.

```max_steering_angle```: The maximum steering angle of the car in radians.

```max_accel```: The maximum acceleration of the car in meters per second squared.

```max_steering_vel```: The maximum steering angle velocity of the car in radians per second.

```friction_coeff```: Coefficient of friction between wheels and ground

```mass```: Mass of car in kilograms

#### Lidar Parameters

```scan_beams```: The number of beams in the scan.

```scan_field_of_view```: The field of view of the lidar, measured in radians. The beams are distributed uniformly throughout this field of view with the first beam being at ```-scan_field_of_view``` and the last beam being at ```scan_field_of_view```. The center of the field of view is direction the racecar is facing.

```scan_distance_to_base_link```: The distance from the lidar to the center of the rear axle (base_link), measured in meters.

```scan_std_dev```: The ammount of noise applied to the lidar measuredments. The noise is gaussian and centered around the correct measurement with standard deviation ```scan_std_dev```, measured in meters.

```map_free_threshold```: The probability threshold for points in the map to be considered "free". This parameter is used to determine what points the simulated scan hits and what points it passes through.

#### Joystick Parameters

```joy```: This boolean parameter enables the joystick if true.

```joy_speed_axis```: The index of the joystick axis used to control the speed of the car. To determine this parameter it may be useful to print out the joystick messages with ```rostopic echo /joy```.

```joy_angle_axis```: The index of the joystick axis used to control the angle of the car.  To determine this parameter it may be useful to print out the joystick messages with ```rostopic echo /joy```.

```joy_button_idx```: The index of the joystick button used to turn on/off joystick driving.
