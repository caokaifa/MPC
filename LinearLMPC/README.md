# Linear LMPC

This code runs the LMPC from [1] and [2] to solve the following constrainted LQR problem:

</p>

The LMPC improves the closed-loop performance until the closed-loop trajectory converges to a steady-state behavior. In this example, the controller iteratively improves the performance until the closed-loop trajectory converges to the unique global optimal solution to the above infinite time constrained LQR problem. For more details we refer to [1].

## LMPC Key Idea and Files

We propose to solve the above CLQR problem iteratively. We perform the regulation task repeatedly and we use the closed-loop data to synthesize the LMPC policy. This folder contains the following files:

1) main.py: this file runs the closed-loop simulations.
2) LMPC.py: the lmpc object is used to store the file and to construct the the safe set and value function approximation which define the LMPC policy (Set CVX = False for the LMPC from [1] and CVX = True for the LMPC from [2]).
3) FTOCP.py: the ftocp object solves a finite time optimal control problem given the initial condition x_t, a terminal contraint set (optional) and a terminal cost function (optional)
4) plot.py: run this files after main.py to plot the closed-loop trajectory, the closed-loop iteration cost and the comparison with the optimal solution to the CLQR problem.
