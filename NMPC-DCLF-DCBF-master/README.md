**Status**: The implementation code for corresponding papers will be merged here and new papers will be added in an inverse order of submission.

### Introduction

In this repository, a collection of our work is presented where nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) are applied.
